  name: IKEA BILRESA (Matter) Dual Button → 2 Lights + Adaptive per Light + Tap Toggle + Long-Hold Release Mode Toggle (No Helpers)
  description: >
    Workflow:
      - Tap (multi_press_1): toggle light on/off
      - Hold (long_press): if held >= threshold, then on release (long_release) toggle mode:
          Adaptive ON -> White mode (Adaptive OFF + force white)
          Adaptive OFF -> Adaptive ON
      - If released before threshold: do nothing
    No helpers needed; uses wait_for_trigger to observe the release event after the hold starts.
